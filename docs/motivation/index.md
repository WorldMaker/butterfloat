# Motivation

I didn't set out to build yet another "web framework". I was very aware
of the stereotypes of how common they are, and how there is a new one
every day. However what I did want didn't exist and I accidentally came
to have a somewhat unique background to build it.

Some of the motivations behind Butterfloat include:

- [Knockout-inspired](./knockout.md)
- [TSX, but not a Virtual DOM](./tsx.md)
- [Pure, RxJS Observables](./pure-observables.md)
- Runtime dependency light: just [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev)
- Compile-time dependency light: Typescript encouraged
