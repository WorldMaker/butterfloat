# Knockout-inspired

[Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/) left a lasting legacy in web
development.

Like Knockout, Butterfloat is focused on providing a way to bind
dynamic changes in a web view. It comes from a perspective that
static DOM elements are more common and the "default" and that
dynamic changes should be bound from Observables.

Butterfloat benefits from advances in Typescript, modern ESM, and
RxJS since Knockout's best years.

Knockout believed in the "Progressive-enhancement" web where more
functionality lights up as JS loads, where some base level of functionality
is still presented even without JS, and that the majority of a web page
is static with changes bound to it not changes driving it.

I think that especially when building "offline-first" [Web Components]
with [Stamps], Butterfloat feels like a return to some of the promises of
"Progress-enhancement" and even better than them in some ways.
