## Properties

### bfDelayValue

â€¢ `Optional` **bfDelayValue**: `Observable`\<`unknown`\>

Delay scheduled binding for the "value" property.

Value is bound immediately by default to avoid user interaction
problems. This provides an opt-in for tested interaction patterns
and rare elements that use "value" for things aren't user
interaction such as <progress />.
